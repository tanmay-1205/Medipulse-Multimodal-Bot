The redness and swelling on your arm are signs of inflammation, which could be due to an allergic reaction to a substance or irritant that came into contact with your skin. Additionally, the rash could be caused by a skin infection or an underlying condition such as eczema or psoriasis. To treat this, I would recommend applying a cold compress to reduce the swelling and inflammation, and using a topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the redness and itching. If the rash persists or worsens, it's best to seek medical attention to rule out any underlying conditions.",,2025-04-03 23:53:40.902835
